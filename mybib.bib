	each with a size of 25&#x00D725&#x00D7150 mm^3, arranged in two identical
	endcaps, with a total weight of 450 kg. The light readout used vacuum
	phototriodes. The endcap calorimeter has been now upgraded to operate
	in the CMD-3 detector at the new VEPP-2000 collider. The major part
	of the endcap calorimeter, BGO crystals, remains the same. The main
	upgrade is the use of silicon PIN photodiodes and new electronics.
	The reason of changing a photosensitive device is a strong non-uniform
	magnetic field in the endcap calorimeter volume making the operation
	of the vacuum photosensitive devices impossible. We also had to reduce
	the space available for the endcap calorimeter. Hamamatsu PIN photodiodes
	S3590-08 were chosen as optimal devices as they are insensitive to
	magnetic fields and are both compact and stable. An order of magnitude
	larger capacitance of silicon photodiodes requires a design and production
	of the new custom electronics. The upgrade is expected to bring an
	overall improvement of the calorimeter parameters. The endcap calorimeter
	has been installed in the detector and operated during the data taking
	that started in 2010. Data analysis shows an improvement of the energy
	resolution compared to the CMD-2 detector.},

  title = {{Theory of strong interactions}},
  journal = {Annals Phys.},
  year = {1960},
  volume = {11},
  pages = {1-48},
  abstract = {All the symmetry models of strong interactions which have been proposed
	up to the present are devoid of deep physical foundations. It is
	suggested that, instead of postulating artificial “higher” symmetries
	which must be broken anyway within the realm of strong interactions,
	we take the existing exact symmetries of strong interactions more
	seriously than before and exploit them to the utmost limit. A new
	theory of strong interactions is proposed on this basis.
	
	Following Yang and Mills we require that the gauge transformations
	that are associated with the three “internal” conservation laws—baryon
	conservation, hypercharge conservation, and isospin conservation—be
	“consistent with the local field concept that underlies the usual
	physical theories.” In analogy with electromagnetism there emerge
	three kinds of couplings such that in each case a massive vector
	field is coupled linearly to the conserved current in question. Each
	of the three fundamental couplings is characterized by a single universal
	constant. Since, as Pais has shown, there are no other internal symmetries
	that are exact, and since any successful theory must be simple, there
	are no other fundamental strong couplings. Parity conservation in
	strong interactions follows as the direct consequence of parity conservation
	of the three fundamental vector couplings. The three vector couplings
	give rise to corresponding current-current interactions. Yukawa-type
	couplings of pions and K particles to baryons are “phenomenological,”
	and may arise, for instance, out of four-baryon current-current interactions
	along the lines suggested by Fermi and Yang. All the successful features
	of Chew-Low type meson theories and of relativistic dispersion relations
	can, in principle, be in accordance with the theory whereas none
	of the predictions based on relativistic Yukawa-type Lagrangians
	are meaningful unless View the MathML source is considerably less
	than unity.
	
	Simple and direct experimental tests of the theory should be looked
	for in those phenomena in which phenomenological Yukawa-type couplings
	are likely to play unimportant roles. The fundamental isospin current
	coupling in the static limit gives rise to a short-range repulsion
	(attraction) between two particles whenever the isospins are parallel
	(antiparallel). Thus the low-energy s-wave πN interaction should
	be repulsive in the View the MathML source state and attractive in
	the View the MathML source state in agreement with observation. In
	πΣ s-wave scattering the T = 0 state is strongly attractive, and
	there definitely exists the possibility of an s-wave resonance at
	energies of the order of the K−p threshold, while the T = 1 πΣ phase
	shift is likely to remain small; using the K matrix formalism of
	Dalitz and Tuan, we might be able to compare the “ideal” phase shifts
	derived in this manner with the “actual” phase shifts deduced from
	K−p reactions. It is expected that the two-pion system exhibits a
	resonant behavior in the T = 1 (p-wave) state in agreement with the
	conjecture of Frazer and Fulco based on the electromagnetic structure
	of the nucleon. The three pion system is expected to exhibit two
	T = 0, J = 1 resonances. It is conjectured that the two View the
	MathML source and one View the MathML source “higher rsonances” in
	the πN interactions may be due to the two T = 0 3π resonances and
	the one T = 1 2π resonance predicted by the theory. Multiple pion
	production is expected at all energies to be more frequent than that
	predicted on the basis of statistical considerations. The fundamental
	hypercharge current coupling gives rise to a short-range repulsion
	(attraction) between two charge-doublet particles when their hypercharges
	are like (opposite). If the isospin current coupling is effectively
	weaker than the hypercharge current coupling, the KN “potential”
	should be repulsive and the View the MathML source “potential” should
	be attractive, and the charge exchange scattering of K+ and K− should
	be relatively rare, at least in s states. All these features seem
	to be in agreement with current experiments. Conditions for the validity
	of Pais' doublet approximation are discussed. The theory offers a
	possible explanation for the long-standing problem as to why associated
	production cross sections are small and K− cross sections are large.
	The empirical fact that the ratio of View the MathML source to (KΛN)
	+ (KΣN) in NN collisions seems to be about twenty to thirty times
	larger than simple statistical considerations indicate is not surprising.
	The fundamental baryonic current coupling gives rise to a short-range
	repulsion for baryon-baryon interactions and an attraction for baryon-antibaryon
	interactions. There should be effects similar to those expected from
	“repulsive cores” for all angular momentum and parity states in both
	the T = 1 and T = 0, NN interactions at short distances though the
	T = 1 state may be more repulsive. A simple Thomas-type calculation
	gives rise to a spin-orbit force of the right sign with not unreasonable
	order of magnitude. The ΛN and ΣN interactions at short distances
	should be somewhat less repulsive than the NN interactions. Annihilation
	cross sections in View the MathML source collisions are expected
	to be large even in Bev regions in contrast to the predictions of
	Ball and Chew. The observed large pion multiplicity in View the MathML
	source annihilations is not mysterious. It is possible to invent
	a reasonable mechanism which makes the reaction View the MathML source
	very rare, as recently observed. Fermi-Landau-Heisenberg type theories
	of high energy collisions are not expected to hold in relativistic
	NN collisions; instead the theory offers a theoretical justification
	for the “two-fire-ball model“ of high-energy jets previously proposed
	on purely phenomenological grounds.
	
	Because of the strong short-range attraction between a baryon and
	antibaryon there exists a mechanism for a baryon-antibaryon pair
	to form a meson. The dynamical basis of the Fermi-Yang-Sakata-Okun
	model as well as that of the Goldhaber-Christy model follows naturally
	from the theory; all the ad hoc assumptions that must be made in
	order that the compound models work at all can be explained from
	first principles. It is suggested that one should not ask which elementary
	particles are “more elementary than others,” and which compound model
	is right, but rather characterize each particle only by its internal
	properties such as total hypercharge and mean-square baryonic radius.
	Although the fundamental couplings of the theory are highly symmetric
	and universal, it is possible for the three couplings alone to account
	for the observed mass spectrum. The theory can explain, in a trivial
	manner, why there are no “elementary” particles with baryon number
	greater than unity provided that the baryonic current coupling is
	sufficiently strong. The question of whether or not an |S| = 2 meson
	exists is a dynamical one (not a group-theoretic one) that depends
	on the strength of the hypercharge current coupling. A possible reason
	for the nonexistence of a π0′ (charge-singlet, nonstrange boson)
	is given. The theory realizes Pais' principles of economy of constants
	and of a hierarchy of interactions in a natural and elegant manner.
	
	It is conjectured that there exists a deep connection between the
	law of conservation of fermions and the universal V-A weak coupling.
	In the absence of strong and electromagnetic interactions, baryonic
	charge, hypercharge, and electric charge all disappear, and only
	the sign of γ5 can distinguish a fermion from an antifermion, the
	fermionic charge being diagonalized by γ5; hence 1 + γ5 appears naturally
	in weak interactions. Parity conservation in strong interactions,
	parity conservation in electromagnetic interactions, parity nonconservation
	in weak interactions can all be understood from the single common
	principle of generalized gauge invariance. It appears that in the
	future ultimate theory of elementary particles all elementary particle
	interactions will be manifestations of the five fundamental vector-type
	couplings corresponding to the five conservation laws of “internal
	attributes”—baryonic charge, hypercharge, isospin, electric charge,
	and fermionic charge. Gravity and cosmology are briefly discussed;
	it is estimated that the Compton wavelength of the graviton is of
	the order of 108 light years.
	
	It is suggested that every conceivable experimental attempt be made
	to detect directly quantum manifestations of the vector fields introduced
	in the theory, especially by studying Q values of pions in various
	combinations in View the MathML source annihilations and in multiple
	pion production.},
